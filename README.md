# lets-learn-neural-networks

This is a small repo for building the basics of a neural network in Python. 

The result of this should be a deeper understanding of how a neural network operates and the ability to leverage a neural network. 

I am doing this while following this video: https://youtu.be/w8yWXqWQYmU by Samson Zhang on YouTube - so all credit goes to him for his awesome work explaining neural networks and demonstrating the basic building blocks. 

I do plan to continue further along with this and the http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ online book as well.
